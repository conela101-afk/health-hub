# Geographic Coverage Review

Reviewed 5 Sep 2026 against 2022 CSO / 2021 NISRA population data, by
computing entries-per-100k-population across all 32 counties.

**Finding:** population density does not fully explain the skew in entry
counts per county — a clear secondary pattern showed up.

## Confirmed genuine gaps (population-adjusted)

Lowest entries per 100k population, relative to county population:

| County | Entries | Population | Entries/100k |
|---|---|---|---|
| Down | 3 | 553,261 | 0.54 |
| Londonderry | 3 | 252,231 | 1.19 |
| Meath | 3 | 220,826 | 1.36 |
| Armagh | 3 | 194,394 | 1.54 |
| Tyrone | 3 | 188,383 | 1.59 |
| Wicklow | 3 | 155,851 | 1.92 |
| Kildare | 6 | 247,774 | 2.42 |
| Wexford | 4 | 163,919 | 2.44 |
| Louth | 4 | 139,703 | 2.86 |
| Mayo | 4 | 137,970 | 2.90 |

These split into two groups:

1. **Dublin commuter-belt counties** (Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth) —
   large populations, but entries likely got absorbed into "Dublin"
   listings rather than logged separately.
2. **NI counties outside Antrim** (Down, Londonderry, Armagh, Tyrone) —
   Belfast/Antrim entries dominate, the other five NI counties are thin.

## Confirmed NOT gaps

Low counts explained by genuinely small populations — proportionate
coverage, not neglect:

- Leitrim (35k, rate 8.52)
- Longford (47k, rate 4.28)
- Cork North (small population within Cork)

## Next research priority order

1. Down, Londonderry, Meath, Armagh, Tyrone (biggest population-to-coverage mismatch)
2. Wicklow, Kildare, Wexford, Louth, Mayo (secondary tier)
3. Leitrim, Longford, Cork North — no action needed, reviewed and closed out.

Next geo review due: Sep 2027.

## Progress update: 6 Sep 2026

Worked the top of the priority list (Down, Londonderry, Meath, plus partial Armagh coverage as a side effect — see `REVIEW.md` for the specific entries added):

| County | Entries (5 Sep) | Entries (6 Sep) | Rate (5 Sep) | Rate (6 Sep) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Down | 3 | 8 | 0.54 | 1.45 |
| Londonderry | 3 | 7 | 1.19 | 2.78 |
| Meath | 3 | 4 | 1.36 | 1.82 |
| Armagh | 3 | 7 | 1.54 | 3.60 |

Real improvement, but none of these are "closed out" yet the way Leitrim/Longford/Cork North are — they've moved off the absolute floor, not up to Cork-City-level adequacy. **Tyrone is now the only untouched county from the original top-5 list.** Wicklow/Kildare/Wexford/Louth/Mayo (secondary tier) also untouched.
